# Lab 6 exercises :-

** Exercise 1 **

Time.c already implemented functions to increment a counter time_tick(), this function should be called each time the hardware clock timer fires. 
Then there is time_ms() to give us the time in ms. note that this time is a relative time and started since time_init() was called which will initiate the counter ticks to zero. 
After this exercise we have a syscall that will give us the time in ms.
